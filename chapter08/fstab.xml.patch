+  <para>Filesystems with MS-DOS or Windows origin (i.e. vfat, ntfs, smbfs,
+  cifs, iso9660, udf) need a special option, utf8, in order for non-ASCII

+  the value of <option>iocharset</option> should be set to be the same as the

+  <option>iocharset=utf8</option> would make the file system case sensitive. To
